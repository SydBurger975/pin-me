# pin-me
#this code craetes a randomized pin of 4 numbers 
#the **subroutine** is called pinPicker
#the **paramater** is called number (how many numbers do i want in my pin?)
#then there is a **string** called "pin", the string is left empty
#and the the "for" **loop**, is used to create a defined amount of random numbers 
#the variable number controls how many times the loop will add a new number to the pin
#this is done through "+=" and **concatenating** new values
#i casted the random number as a string so the program concatenates it togther 
#then return the pin
#assign the variable "myPin" to the subroutine "pinPicker"
#then print "myPin"
